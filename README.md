The project is to write a Java program to test if an array contains a specific value.

This project requires that you know how to use the for loop and how to create an array. I recommend you go into 1 programming college class or learn the basics before doing this project to understand it.

If you need help, either message me at aahmed58@nyit.edu, or search a youtube video on how to do it. Please don't spam me. I will do my best to get back to your message as soon as I can.

I (Ameer) is the only one who maintains this project.
